# MMSS-Thesis

My primary major during my undergraduate studies at Northwestern was Mathematical Methods in the Social Sciences (MMSS).

MMSS is a selective interdisciplinary major and program at Northwestern which combines the fields of Mathematics, Economics, and Statistics through the lens of applying skills learned in those fields to the social sciences. Students must apply for the program before or during their first year at Northwestern and pair the major with another major (I chose History). The program includes coursework from multivariable calculus and social science modeling to game theory and machine learning.

During their senior year, each student in the program must write a senior thesis in which they conduct novel and relevant research on a social science topic of their choice. Each thesis typically consists of a review of existing literature on the subject (I conducted a review of 29 sources), a collection of data, and an analysis of said data.

I chose to write my senior thesis on the impact of college athletics on admissions in higher education.
