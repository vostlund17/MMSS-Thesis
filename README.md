# MMSS-Thesis

My primary major during my undergraduate studies at Northwestern was Mathematical Methods in the Social Sciences (MMSS).

MMSS is a selective interdisciplinary major and program at Northwestern which combines the fields of Mathematics, Economics, and Statistics through the lens of applying skills learned in those fields to the social sciences. Students must apply for the program before or during their first year at Northwestern and pair the major with another major (I chose History). The program includes coursework from multivariable calculus and social science modeling to game theory and machine learning.

During their senior year, each student in the program must write a senior thesis in which they conduct novel and relevant research on a social science topic of their choice. Each thesis typically consists of a review of existing literature on the subject (I conducted a review of 29 sources), a collection of data, and an analysis of said data.

I chose to write my senior thesis on the impact of college athletics on admissions in higher education.

#### Thesis Title:
Hoops and Higher Education: Evaluating how college basketball TV exposure along with a team’s success influences the admissions numbers of universities

#### Thesis Abstract: 
Given the immense pageantry and tremendous investment that surrounds the world of college sports, it should come as no surprise that the role of college athletics within a larger context of higher education is consistently under intense scrutiny. Regular questions are raised about the utility of college sports in general, asking if there are tangible benefits to transferring funds away from aspects of a university like academics and towards athletics. My thesis seeks to answer this question through the lens of basketball and college admissions. Does college athletic success or playing games on national television and ESPN increase application numbers, decrease acceptance rates, increase admissions yield, or increase the test scores of incoming classes in the future? My analysis finds that the link between basketball success and different admissions statistics is weak. However, I do find that basketball appearances on national television and ESPN are correlated with higher application rates and a higher quality student body, in terms of test scores. I therefore conclude that while basketball success does not have a tangible influence on admissions statistics, investment in basketball programs is still important. Maintaining good standing within a big time conference that has television contracts with popular networks requires investment. Similarly, winning games during a season not only produces excitement around a team, making appearances on television more likely, but winning prolongs the season and increases a university’s chances of playing important postseason games on the biggest networks in the country.
